# IWR1843 Radar Data Visualization

This project provides a method for visualizing radar data collected from the IWR1843 radar sensor using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The data is processed and visualized in both 3D and 2D formats, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the radar's detection capabilities over time.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can use Anaconda or pip to manage your Python environment. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smbd1368/visualization-radar-data.git
   cd visualization-radar-data
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   conda create -n radar-visualization python=3.8
   conda activate radar-visualization
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your radar data file (`detObj2.txt`) in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebook file (e.g., `Untitled.ipynb`) and run the cells to visualize the data.

## Data Format

The radar data should be in a text file (`detObj2.txt`) with each line formatted as JSON. Each JSON object should contain the following keys:
- `time`: A timestamp for the data point.
- `numObj`: The number of detected objects.
- `x`: An array of x-coordinates for the detected objects.
- `y`: An array of y-coordinates for the detected objects.
- `z`: An array of z-coordinates for the detected objects.
- `doppler`: An array of Doppler values for the detected objects.
- `snr`: An array of Signal-to-Noise Ratio values for the detected objects.
- `noise`: An array of noise values for the detected objects.

### Example JSON Line
```json
{"time": "2023-01-01T12:00:00", "numObj": 2, "x": [1.0, 2.0], "y": [3.0, 4.0], "z": [5.0, 6.0], "doppler": [0.5, 0.6], "snr": [10, 12], "noise": [1, 1]}
```

## Visualizations

The project includes two types of visualizations:

1. **3D Motion Visualization**: Displays the detected objects in a 3D scatter plot, where the color represents the time progression.

2. **2D Motion Animation**: Animates the movement of detected objects in a 2D plane and plots the Z coordinate over time.
